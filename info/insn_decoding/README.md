# DSP instruction decoding 
Discovering how instructions are encoded is fundamental to building a disassembler/assembler for the architecture. Unluckily, there's no information about this other than the huge lookup table we've created in [`t32_insn_bruteforce`](https://github.com/fxsheep/seewa-eks/tree/main/info/t32_insn_bruteforce), so we'll have to manually discover encodings from it.

## Instruction class
After a brief comparison in `insn_16.txt`, it turns out that the encoding is a mess.
I've tried 4 and 5 leading bits as instruction opcode field, neither worked - opcode determination seems to be split into multiple parts, there's 4 leading bits deciding (roughly) the 'class' of instruction, i.e. which particular execution unit this insn for, then the specific op is decided by latter fields, and they're different per class.
 - Leading 4bit field -> instruction class
